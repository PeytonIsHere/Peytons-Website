        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2>Hey there, I'm Peyton!</h2>

        <h3>Intro:</h3>
        <p>Hey everyone! I'm Peyton, a tech enthusiast who's all about diving into the world of computers and coding. Whether it's building computers or digging into the latest tech trends, count me in!</p>

        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>I've spent plenty of time coding, tinkering with hardware, and just generally exploring anything tech-related.</p>

        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p>When I'm not on my computer, you can find me outside mountain biking or on my motorcycle. When I say motorcycle I mean I only got a scooter (moped) its been my project for a bit that I have been upgrading, but I wish I had an R3 or something that would not give me a ticket for going too slow on a freeway.</p>

        <h3>Values:</h3>
        <p>I'm into learning and growing, both personally and professionally. Whether it's mastering a new coding language or tackling the next cybersecurity challenge, I'm always up for a good challenge.</p>

        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>I've got some solid skills in coding, especially in Java. I'm also know HTML/CSS, and Rust. I have lots of knowledge with Linux, and I can handle basic networking. I’ve set up a few VM’s to run juice shop and other cybersecurity challenges. Plus, I've got a few projects up on GitHub, where I'm learning and experimenting.</p>

        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <p>My big goal? To carve out a career in cybersecurity. I'm always wanting more knowledge and experience, whether it's through courses, hands-on projects, or with reading anything I can.</p>

        <h3>This Website:</h3>
        <p>This website that you are currently on is hosted by me (if you could not tell already by the awful design it has). I would love to make my own homelab to host movies, NAS, websites or whatever else I find interesting.</p>

        <h3>Closing:</h3>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit about me! If you want to make this website any better check me out on <a href="https://github.com/PeytonIsHere">GitHub</a>.</p>
