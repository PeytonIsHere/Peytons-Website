      Once upon a time, there was a child. That child had no missing assignments
      and he was in a class that you work on homework and missing assignments
      in. he had no homework or missing assignments. He also had no book to read
      and no water to drink. Then he thought, “I’m going to make a website.” And
      he did. And he lived happily ever after
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there was a moose. That moose had antlers. One day he
      dicided he didn't want antlers. So he decided to turn himself into a deer.

      Once upon a time, there was a puppy. The puppy's name was Beck. Beck liked
      to bite, lick, and gnaw on things. One day, a familiar person who always
      fed him was walking by. He decided that he wanted to bite something, so he
      chomped the guy's leg. Then Beck got kicked into the street, and stayed
      there his whole life. And he lived saddly ever after.
